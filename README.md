# Rick and Morty

Rick and Morty Explorer is an Android application that fetches data from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and displays a list of characters from the show. The app is built using XML layouts and follows the MVVM architecture pattern. It includes features for listing characters, viewing detailed information for each character, and saving favorite characters locally.

- Character Details: View detailed information about each character.
- Favorites: Save characters to a favorites list for quick access.
